     * Creates a <tt>DateFormatter</tt> object. The picture is a format string for the date.
     * DataPerfect does not seem to do a whole lot of validation on the picture so DANS DataPerfect
     * Library does not do that, either. The following are the assumptions about what constitutes a
     * valid format and what type of formatting it results in.
     * <p>
     * The date picture consists of:
     * <ol>
     * <li>a capital letter D
     * <li>optionally the three letters: D, M and Y in any order (default: "MDY")
     * <li>one ore more groups of two or more 9 characters, separated by by non-9 characters
     * </ol>
     * The first D indicates that the type of data formatted is a date. The D, M and Y specify the
     * order of the subsequent day month and year fields. The groups of 9's indicate where the
     * numbers go.
     * <p>
     * Examples. The following examples use the date 10 December 1948.
     * <table border="1">
     * <tr>
     * <th align="left">Format</th>
     * <th align="left">Result</th>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     * <td>D99/99/99</td>
     * <td>12/10/48</td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     * <td>DDMY99-99-99</td>
     * <td>10-12-48</td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     * <td>DYMD9999/99</td>
     * <td>1948/12</td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     * <td>DYMD9999/99/99</td>
     * <td>1948/12/10</td>
     * </tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * An excess of 9's will result in the number in case being padded from the left with zero's. A
     * shortage of 9's will result in the number being truncated from the left.
     *
     * @param picture the picture to use when formatting a numeric date representation
     * @param defaultDateOrder the date order to use if none was provided in the picture

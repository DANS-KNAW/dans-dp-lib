/**
 * A record in a panel. This is basically a map from a field name or number to its value in the
 * record. In DataPerfect every field has a number, but name is an optional attribute. Even so, it
 * is often more convenient to look up a value based on the field name.
 * <p>
 * All values can be retrieved as <tt>String</tt>s. The string returned is the representation of the
 * value as produced by the DataPerfect user interface, i.e. after applying the format.
 * <p>
 * Numeric, date and time values can also be retrieved as <tt>Number</tt>s. The number is, however,
 * always the integral value stored. Even fixed-point fractional numbers are returned as the
 * integral that is formed by leaving out the decimal point. Dates are stored as the number of days
 * after 1 March 1900. Times are stored as number of seconds after midnight.

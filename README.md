DANS DataPerfect Library - read DataPerfect files

DESCRIPTION
===========

Java library to read the contents of old [DataPerfect] databases. It was produced for the [MIXED] project.
It is no longer maintained. You are however free to fork it, if you wish.

There are no JavaDocs online, but they can be built locally with `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. After this they should 
be available at `<project dir>/target/site/apidocs/index.html`.

Also, there may still be a version of the project site [at SourceForge](http://dans-dp-lib.sourceforge.net/).
